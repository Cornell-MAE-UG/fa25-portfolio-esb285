For this project, I assisted my group by disassembling the dehumidifier and documenting the process through measurements and photographs. I also researched solenoid valves and created slides explaining how fluid mechanics concepts influence the valve’s operation and why this type of valve is useful in the system. In particular, I highlighted the Bernoulli equation and related principles to perform a fluid analysis of this component. Additionally, I was responsible for editing the final video by compiling and organizing the footage submitted by each group member.
