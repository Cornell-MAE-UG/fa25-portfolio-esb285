For the Mechanics of Materials (MAE 3270) course, the final project was to design a wrench that fulfilled a multitude of design criteria using hand calculations as well as ANSYS to do the analysis. The hand calculations were based on this set up, (Figure 1)

using the beam theory assumption. The design criteria included having at least a factor of safety against yield of 4, a factor of safety against crack growth of 2, a factor of safety against fatigue of 1.5, as well as a voltage output of at least 1.00 mV/V. A MATLAB code was created to aid in calculating these data for a variety of measurements and material properties. The MATLAB code used is shown below: 

INSERT CODE

The wrench was CADed using Autodesk FUSION 360. After multiple iterations, a wrench with the following dimensions was designed, (Figure 2)

INSERT DIMENSIONS PHOTO

The wrench was created to be small and similar in size to a real wrench used in practice. Fillets were added to remove stress concentrations that would occur as well as improve the overall design of the wrench. Some of the more critical dimensions of the wrench are a length of …., width of … in, and a height of …. In. The drive has a length and width of … in and a height of … in as mandated by the project criteria. 

The material of this wrench was decided to be Aluminium, 2424, T3. This aluminum has a Young’s modulus of 9.86 Msi, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.333, a tensile strength of …. ksi, a fracture toughness of …. Ksi, and a fatigue strength of … at 10^6 cycles. These material properties were found through Granta’s EduPack level 3 material database. This material was chosen through inputting the design dimensions in a MATLAB function and getting minimum and maximum values of significant material properties. This information was then used to filter through materials in Granta’s material database to obtain a material that would fit the design criteria. The MATLAB function created is provided below:

INSERT CODE 

The material, Aluminum-2424-T3, not only fits the design criteria but is relatively less expensive compared to other materials like Titanium alloys that could be used for similar designs.

Using ANSYS, the wrench was analysed using a load of 66.67 lbf applied horizontally a distance of 9 in from the end of the drive (to simulate a person applying force) and two different boundary conditions, one where the two parts of the drive were clamped and one where only the top part was clamped (Figure 3).

The analysis of the wrench was done with three different mesh conditions:
Coarse Mesh: Wrench: 0.175 in, Drive: 0.1 in
Refined Mesh: Wrench: 0.125 in, Drive: 0.06 in
Very Refined Mesh: Wrench: 0.075 in, Drive: 0.03 in 

The strain gauge selected to be used is ……: 

INSERT STRAIN GAUGE

This is a half-bridge strain gauge with a length of …, width of …., and depth of ….. It is made for Aluminum and would be located an inch from the drive as shown in figure 1. The sensitivity is …. 

The results of the FEM analysis will be split into two parts where, first, the unclamped fillet with the different mesh sizes results will be shown and then the clamped fillet results will be shown. 

Unclamped Fillet FEM Analysis

The maximum normal strain for the coarse, refined, and very refined mesh were found to be ………, respectively, at the bottom of the drive, excluding the maximum that was found at the boundary condition (Figure 4).

The maximum normal stress for the coarse, refined, and very refined mesh were found to be ……… , respectively, at the bottom of the drive, excluding the maximum that was found at the boundary condition. The maximum normal stress at the face where the load was applied was also determined using a probe, as this would resemble more closely the hand calculated maximum stress, and was ….., respectively (Figure 5).

The maximum displacement for the coarse, refined, and very refined mesh were found to be ………, respectively (Figure 6).

A strain probe was used to find the torque sensitivity of the wrench in in/in which was converted to mV/V to analyse what a strain gauge at that location would have recorded. The strain result was …. respectively (Figure 7).

The maximum normal strain for the coarse, refined, and very refined mesh were found to be ………, respectively, at the bottom of the drive, excluding the maximum that was found at the boundary condition (Figure 8).

Summary of FEM Results

Below is a table summarizing the results under the different conditions:

INSERT TABLE

Overall, the …… The torque sensitivity from all conditions closely resembled the one from the hand-calculation. The maximum displacement is higher in the FEM analysis and a reason that this may occur is due to the fact that stress and strain have a linear relationship and the FEM maximum normal stress is significantly higher than the hand-calculated stress. The maximum stress is higher both at the drive and at the face where the load is applied compared to the hand-calculated stress most likely due to the hand-calculation not taking into account the fillets and full design of the wrench. The arbitrarily high normal stress that occurs is due to stress concentrations due to the boundary conditions applied.
