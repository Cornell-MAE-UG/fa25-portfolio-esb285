For the Mechanics of Materials (MAE 3270) course, the final project was to design a wrench that fulfilled a multitude of design criteria using hand calculations as well as ANSYS to do the analysis. The hand calculations were based on this set up,

![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "/assets/images/actual_images_used/Ansys Images/fig1b.png" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}

using the beam theory assumption. The design criteria included having at least a factor of safety against yield of 4, a factor of safety against crack growth of 2, a factor of safety against fatigue of 1.5, as well as a voltage output of at least 1.00 mV/V. A MATLAB code was created to aid in calculating these data for a variety of measurements and material properties. The MATLAB code used is shown below: 

```MATLAB
    function hand=hand_calc(L, h, b)
        disp(strcat('L:', num2str(L), ', h:', num2str(h), ', b:', num2str(b)))
        M = 600; % max torque (in-lbf)
        c = 1.0; % distance from center of drive to center of strain gauge
        E = 9.86E6; % Young's modulus (psi)
        nu = 0.333; % Poisson's ratio
        su = 61.2E3; % tensile strength use yield or ultimate depending on material (psi)
        KIC = 24.6E3; % fracture toughness (psi sqrt(in))
        sfatigue = 30.e3; % fatigue strength from Granta for 10^6 cycles
        k=2;

        p=M/L;
        s=6*M/(b*h^2);
        s_0=s/10^3;
        X=su/s;
        disp(strcat('Max stress: ', num2str(s_0), 'psi'))
        disp(strcat('X_0: ', num2str(X)));
        disp(strcat('Does X_0 pass?_', num2str(X>=4)))


        %% Calculating Max Displacement
        I=(b*h^3)/12;
        displacement=(p*L^3)/(3*E*I);
        disp(strcat('Displacement: ', num2str(displacement), ' in'));

        %% Calculating strain
        st1=(s/E)*(L-c)/L;
        st2=-st1;
        st=k*(st1-st2)*(10^6)/4; % mV/V
        disp(strcat('Strain: ', num2str(st), ' microstrain'));
        disp(strcat('Output: ', num2str(st/1000), 'mV/V'))
        disp(strcat('Does strain pass?_', num2str(st/1000>=1)))

        %%Calculate factor of safety of crack growth
        a = 0.04; %crack depth (in) (0.01 mm)
        F=1.12;
        Sg = 6*M/(b*h^2);
        K = F*Sg*sqrt(pi*a);
        Xk=KIC/K;
        disp(strcat('X_k: ', num2str(Xk)));
        disp(strcat('Does X_k pass?_', num2str(Xk>=2)))

        %%Calculate factor of safety of fatigue stress
        Xs=sfatigue*b*h^2/(6*M);
        disp(strcat('X_s: ', num2str(Xs)));
        disp(strcat('Does X_s pass?_', num2str(Xs>=1.5)))
        disp('-----')

        end
    hand_calc(9,0.8,0.5);
```

The wrench was CADed using Autodesk FUSION 360. After multiple iterations, a wrench with the following dimensions was designed,

![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "/assets/images/actual_images_used/Ansys Images/fig2a.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}
![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "/assets/images/actual_images_used/Ansys Images/fig2b.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}
![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "/assets/images/actual_images_used/Ansys Images/fig2c.png" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}

The wrench was created to be small and similar in size to a real wrench used in practice. Fillets were added to remove stress concentrations that would occur as well as improve the overall design of the wrench. Some of the more critical dimensions of the wrench handle are a length of 12.75 in, width of 0.8 in, and a height of 0.5 in. In. The drive has a length and width of 0.375 in and a height of 0.5 in, as mandated by the project criteria. 

The material of this wrench was decided to be Aluminium-2424-T3. This aluminum has a Young’s modulus of 9.86 Msi, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.333, a tensile strength of 61.2 ksi, a fracture toughness of 24.6 ksi*sqrt(in), and a fatigue strength of 30.0 ksi at 10^6 cycles. These material properties were found through Granta’s EduPack level 3 material database. This material was chosen through inputting the design dimensions in a MATLAB function and getting minimum and maximum values of significant material properties. This information was then used to filter through materials in Granta’s material database to obtain a material that would fit the design criteria. The MATLAB function created is provided below:

```MATLAB
    function material=find_material(L, h, b)
        disp(strcat('L:', num2str(L), ', h:', num2str(h), ', b:', num2str(b)))
        M = 600; % max torque (in-lbf)
        c = 1.0; % distance from center of drive to center of strain gauge
        nu = 0.335; % Poisson's ratio
        k=2;

        X=4;
        s=6*M/(b*h^2);
        su = X*s;
        disp(strcat('Min su:  ', num2str(su), 'psi'));

        st=1;
        E=k*s*(L-c)*10^3/(2*st*L);
        disp(strcat('Max Youngs mod:  ', num2str(E), 'psi'));

        %%Calculate factor of safety of crack growth
        a = 0.04; %crack depth (in) (0.01 mm)
        Xk=2;
        F=1.12;
        Sg = 6*M/(b*h^2);
        K = F*Sg*sqrt(pi*a);
        KIC=Xk*K;
        disp(strcat('KIC min:  ', num2str(KIC)));

        %%Calculate factor of safety of fatigue stress
        Xs = 1.5;
        sfatigue=Xs*(6*M)/(b*h^2);
        disp(strcat('sfatigue min:  ', num2str(sfatigue)));
        disp('-----')


        end

    find_material(9, 0.8, 0.5);
```

The material, Aluminum-2424-T3, not only fits the design criteria but is relatively less expensive compared to other materials like Titanium alloys that could be used for similar designs.

Using ANSYS, the wrench was analysed using a load of 66.67 lbf applied horizontally a distance of 9 in from the end of the drive (to simulate a person applying force) and two different boundary conditions,  one where only the top part was clamped and one where the top and fillet part of the drive were clamped.

![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "/assets/images/actual_images_used/Ansys Images/fig3b.JPG" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}

The analysis of the wrench was done with three different mesh conditions:

Coarse Mesh: Wrench: 0.175 in, Drive: 0.1 in
Refined Mesh: Wrench: 0.125 in, Drive: 0.06 in
Very Refined Mesh: Wrench: 0.075 in, Drive: 0.03 in 

The strain gauge selected to be used is SGT-1LH/350-TY43 by DWYEROMEGA: 

![Hand-calculation Diagrams]({{ "assets/images/actual_images_used/SGT_HALF-BRIDGE-UNIAXIAL_m.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 350px"}

This is a half-bridge strain gauge with a length of 0.362 in and a width of 0.157 in. It is made for Aluminum and would be located an inch from the drive.

The results of the FEM analysis will be split into two parts where, first, the unclamped fillet with the different mesh sizes results will be shown and then the clamped fillet results will be shown. 

**Unclamped Fillet FEM Analysis**

The maximum normal strain for the coarse, refined, and very refined mesh were found to be 3.12e-3, 3.23e-3, and 4.24e-3, respectively.

A strain probe was used to find the torque sensitivity of the wrench in in/in which was converted to mV/V to analyse what a strain gauge at that location would have recorded. The strain result was (in mV/V) 1.018, 1.020, and 1.018, respectively.

Overall, there is a trend of the maximum normal stress and strain increasing as the mesh is more refined. The maximum normal stress and strain also decrease from unclamped fillet condition to clamped fillet condition. These trends can be explained to the FEM analysis overextimating stress concentrations. The maximum normal stress is higher compared to the hand-calculated stress most likely due to the hand-calculation not taking into account the fillets and full design of the wrench. The maximum displacement is higher in the FEM analysis and a reason that this may occur is due to the fact that stress and strain have a linear relationship and the FEM maximum normal stress is significantly higher than the hand-calculated stress. The torque sensitivity is fairly similar to the hand-calculated one and is fairly similar regardless of boundary and mesh conditions.
